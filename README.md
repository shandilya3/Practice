[COPIED FROM INTERNET] NOT MY THOUGHTS
Slow is Smooth, Smooth is Fast
The "slow is smooth, smooth is fast" concept likely has its origins in the Military. Within that context, moving fast (or rushing it) is reckless and can potentially be fatal. However, if you move slowly, carefully and deliberately, you're actually moving as fast as you can without needlessly increasing the risk on your life.

Practicing at reduced speeds will make you faster when you go full speed. Full speed is often slower than you think, and there is a difference between going full speed and being rushed. When you are rushed you stumble, fumble, and are generally all thumbs (or have two left feet). When you go full speed you are going as fast as you can comfortably go.

Martial artists do this, Soldiers do this, in fact, anyone trying to master a technique would do well to practice slowly and increase speed only when it's comfortable.

Doc Holiday said, "Take your time in a hurry" to describe how to win a gunfight. [1]

With firearms, precision and accuracy get you the desired result---put the bullet through something vital and you put the man down. Miss and you get nothing.

The expression comes from the rifle range. It's what Marine Corps instructors tell their trainees regarding loading, unloading, aiming, etc. It's an expression from the range that bleeds over into other areas of the Military and into the civilian world.

Because the same "principles of violence" apply no matter what the tool we use, the same truth applies when it comes to using a knife, a stick, your boot, or empty hands---precision and accuracy get you the desired results. Put your boot through something vital and you put the man down. Miss and you get nothing.

Slow practice is target practice---it gives you the time to get it done right, as well as the time to be aware of your mistakes so you can correct them and learn from them.

Train yourself to relax and perform the steps with efficient precision. Train to relax, train to focus, train to muscle memory. When you're relaxed and calm and need to move fast, you'll move like lightening.

In the end, the person who gets it done right gets to go home. Taking your time with slow practice makes sure thatâ€™s you.

### How to contribute? 

1.  Fork the repository
2.  Do the desired changes (add/delete/modify)
3.  Make a pull request

### When to contribute?

1.  If there is no solution to a problem.
2.  If your solution is asymptotically faster than the one in the main branch.
3.  If your algorithm is of the same time complexity but with reduced code size it would be better to, comment out the original solution and make a pull request with your solution.
